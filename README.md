# Snake Game

## Overview

This is a classic Snake game implemented in Python using the `turtle` module. The game features a snake that moves around the screen, eating food and growing longer. The objective is to navigate the snake to collect as much food as possible without running into itself or running out of time.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive gameplay.
- Snake grows longer as it eats food.
- Food randomly appears on the screen.
- Countdown timer that resets when food is eaten.
- Game over when the snake collides with itself or the snake is not able to eat the food before the timer hits 0.
- Score tracking and high score display.
